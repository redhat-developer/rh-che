= Openshift Connector for Eclipse Che

Current plan for OpenShift integration to Che project:

1. Provide PR with initial OpenShift Connector implementation to Che project

2. Implement all OpenShift connector methods

3. Define SPI

image::images/che-on-openshift/spi.png[width="500", height="300",aption="SPI"]

[start=4]
4. Refactor OpenShift Connector for using SPI

NOTE: working on item *3* could start before *2* is completed.

NOTE: Epic Jira - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-26[OpenShift Integration to Che]

## Workflow

First thing, make sure that you can build `openshift-connector` branch:

```
cd che/

git fetch origin openshift-connector:openshift-connector
git checkout openshift-connector

mvn -Dskip-enforce -Dskip-validate-sources -DskipTests -Dfindbugs.skip -Dgwt.compiler.localWorkers=2 -T 1C clean install
```

NOTE: For now PRs are expected to be provided against `openshift-connector` branch


== How to deploy Eclipse Che (`openshift-connector` branch) on Minishift?

Pre-requirements:

- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) - `v1.2.2` and above
- Minishift (`minishift`) - `v0.9.0` and above

First 4 steps are identical to the ones described in https://github.com/l0rd/openche#deployment-che-on-minishift[Deployment Che on Minishift] document. 

[start=5]
5. build 'codenvy/che-server:local' image:

```sh
# Get the script from github
git clone https://github.com/l0rd/openche
cd openche

export GITHUB_REPO=path/to/che
./build_che.sh 
```

NOTE: Minishift docker daemon should be used for building the image: `eval $(minishift docker-env)`

[start=6]
6. Update Openshift template `che.json` / `che_debug.json` with the following values:


```
HOSTNAME_HTTP => che.openshift.mini
CHE_SERVER_DOCKER_IMAGE => codenvy/che-server:local
CHE_OPENSHIFT_ENDPOINT => https://$(minishift ip):8443 e.g. https://192.168.42.195:8443

imagePullPolicy => "IfNotPresent"
```
[start=7]
7. Deploy Che:

```
oc login -u openshift-dev -p devel
export CHE_HOSTNAME=che.openshift.mini
export CHE_IMAGE=codenvy/che-server:local
export DOCKER0_IP=$(docker run -ti --rm --net=host alpine ip addr show docker0 | grep "inet\b" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)
export CHE_OPENSHIFT_ENDPOINT=https://$(minishift ip):8443

# If a previous version of Che was deployed, delete it
./openche.sh delete

# Install OpenShift Che template and deploy Che 
./openche.sh deploy

```
NOTE: For removing Che workspaces `./remove_ws.sh` script can be used

== Debugging Che on Minishift

In order to debug Che running on Minishift `che_debug.json` template should be used. Just change `DEFAULT_CHE_TEMPLATE` value in `openche.sh`:

```
DEFAULT_CHE_TEMPLATE="./che_debug.json"
```

Other steps are identical to the ones described in the previous section. Once Che is deployed you can see that the port for debugging is exposed by `che-host` service: 

image::images/che-on-openshift/debug_port.png[width="700", height="300",aption="Debugging Port"]

Now you can use it for remote debugging in your IDE:

NOTE: Hot swap debugging feature does not work for Eclipse IDE. In order to make changes in the code rebuilding / redeploying `codenvy/che-server:local` image is required

NOTE: More info about Che remote debugging can be found in the document https://github.com/ibuziuk/docs/blob/master/che_remote_debugging.adoc[Eclipse Che - remote debugging setup]
