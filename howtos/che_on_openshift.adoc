= Openshift Connector for Eclipse Che

Current plan for OpenShift integration to Che project:

1. Provide PR with initial OpenShift Connector implementation to Che project

2. Implement all OpenShift connector methods

3. Define SPI

[start=4]
4. Refactor OpenShift Connector for using SPI

NOTE: working on item *3* could start before *2* is completed.

NOTE: Epic Jira - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-26[OpenShift Integration to Che]

## Workflow

First thing, make sure that you can build `openshift-connector` branch:

```
cd che/

git fetch origin openshift-connector:openshift-connector
git checkout openshift-connector

mvn -Dskip-enforce -Dskip-validate-sources -DskipTests -Dfindbugs.skip -Dgwt.compiler.localWorkers=2 -T 1C clean install
```

NOTE: For now PRs are expected to be provided against `openshift-connector` branch


== How to deploy Eclipse Che (`openshift-connector` branch) on Minishift?

Pre-requirements:

- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) - `v1.2.2` and above
- Minishift (`minishift`) - `v0.9.0` and above

Detailed instructions can be found in the https://github.com/redhat-developer/rh-che/tree/master/os-templates#deployment-che-on-minishift[Deployment Che on Minishift] document.

== Debugging Che on Minishift

In order to debug Che running on Minishift `che_debug.json` template should be used. Just change `DEFAULT_CHE_TEMPLATE` value in `openche.sh`:

```
DEFAULT_CHE_TEMPLATE="./che_debug.json"
```

Other steps are identical to the ones described in the previous section. Once Che is deployed you can see that the port for debugging is exposed by `che-host` service:

Now you can use it for remote debugging in your IDE:

NOTE: Hot swap debugging feature does not work for Eclipse IDE. In order to make changes in the code rebuilding / redeploying `codenvy/che-server:local` image is required
